** Browserify

Phaser and Browserify do not play well together which makes it difficult to add Phaser as a direct dependency. The solution is to add Phaser as a dependency and include the Phaser distributable build directly into your project, then configure browserify to accept it as a global. For brevity this project just includes it via a cdn and sets browserify to know about it as a global.

There are a few hacks around to include it in the bundle but itâ€™s not worth the fight.
